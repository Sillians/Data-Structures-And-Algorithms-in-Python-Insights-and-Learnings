Building Clang from source on Linux involves several steps, including downloading the source code, 
resolving dependencies, configuring the build options, and compiling the toolchain. 
Here’s a detailed guide to help you build Clang on a Linux system:

**Prerequisites**
1. **Operating System**: Ensure you have a Linux distribution installed. `Ubuntu`, `Fedora`, or `CentOS` 
are commonly used for building Clang.

2. **Required Tools and Libraries**: You need to have `cmake`, `make`, `gcc`, `g++`, and `python` installed to build Clang. 
You might also need additional development libraries depending on your Linux distribution.


### Step-by-Step Guide
**Step 1: Install Required Packages**

For Ubuntu, Update the Package List:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

You can install the required packages and dependencies using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake git python3 libtool libssl-dev
```

For `Fedora/CentOS`, the command might look like:
```bash
sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ cmake3 make git python3
```


**Step 2: Download and Clone the LLVM Source Code**
You can download the source code using git. It’s recommended to get the sources from the official `LLVM monorepo`. 
- The LLVM project includes Clang as one of its sub-projects. Change directory to where you want the llvm directory placed.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
cd llvm-project
```

The above command is very slow. It can be made faster by creating a shallow clone. 
Shallow clone saves storage and speeds up the checkout time. This is done by using the command:
```bash 
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
cd llvm-project
```
(using this only the latest version of llvm can be built)


**Step 3: Configure, Build LLVM and Clang**
Create a directory for building, It’s good practice to build LLVM/Clang in a separate directory:
```bash
mkdir build  # (in-tree build is not supported)
cd build
```
This builds both LLVM and Clang in release mode.


Configure the build using `cmake`. Here, you can customize build options like installation directory or build type:
```bash
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../llvm
```

- `-G "Unix Makefiles"` specifies the generator, which is Makefiles in this case.
- `-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang"` includes the Clang project.
- `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` builds the compiler in release mode (you can choose `Debug` for a debug build).


**Step 4: Build Clang**
Compile Clang using:
```bash 
make -j$(nproc)
```
- `make -j$(nproc)` uses all available processors to speed up the build process.


**Step 5: Install Clang (Optional)**
To install Clang, use:
```bash
sudo make install
```
This step is optional. If you prefer, you can use Clang directly from the build directory.

### Verify Installation
After installation, you can verify that Clang is correctly installed by checking its version:
```bash
clang --version
```

### Troubleshooting
- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary development libraries are installed. 
Some specific libraries may be required depending on your Linux distribution.

- **Build Errors**: Look at the error messages carefully. They often provide hints about what’s missing or what went wrong.

- **Insufficient Resources**: Building LLVM/Clang can be resource-intensive. Ensure your machine has enough RAM and disk space.

This process compiles Clang from the source, giving you the flexibility to customize your build according to your needs. 
Remember that compiling LLVM and Clang from source can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, depending on your system's specifications.
