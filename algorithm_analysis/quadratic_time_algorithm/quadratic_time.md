In order to analyze the `prefix_average1` algorithm, we consider the various steps that are executed.

- The statement, `n = len(S)`, executes in constant time.
- The statement, `A = [0] * n`, causes the creation and initialization of a Python list with length `n`, 
and with all entries equal to zero. This uses a constant number of primitive operations per element, 
and thus runs in `O(n)` time.
- There are two nested for loops, which are controlled, respectively, by counters `j` and `i`. 
The body of the outer loop, controlled by counter `j`, is executed `n` times, for `j = 0, . . . , n − 1`. 
Therefore, statements `total = 0` and `A[j] = total / (j+1)` are executed `n` times each. 
This implies that these two statements, plus the management of counter `j` in the range, 
contribute a number of primitive operations proportional to `n`, that is, `O(n)` time.
- The body of the inner loop, which is controlled by counter `i`, is executed `j + 1` times, 
depending on the current value of the outer loop counter `j`. Thus, statement `total += S[i]`, 
in the inner loop, is executed `1+2+3+···+n` times. By recalling, we know that `1+2+3+···+n = n(n+1)/2`, 
which implies that the statement in the inner loop contributes $O(n^{2})$ time. A similar argument can be done for 
the primitive operations associated with maintaining counter `i`, which also take $O(n^{2})$ time.

The running time of implementation prefix average1 is given by the sum of three terms. 
The first and the second terms are `O(n)`, and the third term is $O(n^{2})$. 
Thus, the running time of `prefix_average1` is $O(n^{2})$.


Analyzing the `prefix_average2` function, This approach is essentially the same high-level algorithm as in `prefix_average1`, 
but we have replaced the inner loop by using the single expression `sum(S[0:j+1])` to compute the partial sum, 
`S[0] + · · · + S[ j]`. While the use of that function greatly simplifies the presentation of the algorithm, 
it is worth asking how it affects the efficiency. Asymptotically, this implementation is no better. 
Even though the expression, `sum(S[0:j+1])`, seems like a single command, it is a function call and an 
evaluation of that function takes `O(j + 1)` time in this context.

Technically, the computation of the slice, `S[0:j+1]`, also uses `O(j + 1)` time, as it constructs a new 
list instance for storage. So the running time of `prefix_average2` is still dominated by a series of 
steps that take time proportional to `1+2+3+···+n`, and thus $O(n^{2})$.
