## Asymptotic Analysis

Asymptotic analysis is a branch of mathematics that deals with the behavior of functions when their arguments tend to infinity.
It consists of asymptotic expansions, series, estimates and notations which are used to obtain an approximate solution or asymptotic solution for problems that cannot be solved exactly. 

In general, asymptotic analysis is useful in understanding how certain mathematical objects behave under different conditions and parameters. This helps in predicting outcomes without having to go through long calculations or simulations.

### Types Of Asymptotic Notations
Asymptotic analysis is a mathematical technique used for understanding the behavior of algorithms as their input increases. It uses asymptotic notations to describe the growth rate or time complexity of an algorithm, which allows us to compare different algorithms and understand how they perform in realistic scenarios.

The three most common types of asymptotic notation are `big O(O)`, `little o(o)` `Omega Notation` and `Big Theta notation (Θ)`.

- `Big O` notation describes the worst-case scenario when the size of inputs grows infinitely large. 
- `Little o` notation measures how close two functions get to each other as the size of input approaches infinity. 
- Finally, `Theta notation` gives upper and lower bounds on the running time, allowing us to determine the exact order of magnitude at which it grows with larger inputs.

These notations help us better understand the asymptotic behavior of algorithms so that we can make improvements if needed, or choose one over another depending on our requirements. 
Asymptotic expansions and methods also allow us to analyze complex computations by breaking them down into simpler components, making mathematical analysis easier and more accurate. 
Understanding these concepts helps provide insight into an algorithm's expected performance in terms of its time complexity and overall efficiency.

1. Big O Notation: 

Big O Notation is a mathematical notation used in the analysis of algorithms to describe their `time complexity`. 
It allows for an estimation of the running time complexity, which can range from best and average cases to worst case 
scenarios. This notation is also referred to as `Big Oh` or `Order of Magnitude` because it provides an upper bound 
on the growth rate of a finite sum.

The main idea behind `big oh` notation is that it takes into account both the maximum time required by an algorithm 
and its constant factor, while eliminating any lower order terms. In other words, this notation helps determine 
how well an algorithm scales with respect to its input size. 

For example, if an algorithm's runtime increases linearly with increasing input size 
(i.e., doubling the input size results in double the number of steps taken by the algorithm), 
then its time complexity would be expressed as `“O(n)”` where `n` represents the total amount 
of input data points processed by the algorithm.

Ultimately, understanding and applying `Big O` Notation can help developers better understand how their code 
will scale up over time and enable them to make more informed decisions about what methods they should use 
when developing software applications.


2. Little O Notation:

Little o notation is a mathematical notation used in asymptotic analysis to measure an algorithm's complexity. 
It is closely related to big O notation and is often used with regard to upper bounds, normal approximations, 
Taylor Series, Laplace Method or Euler Maclaurin Summation Formula. Little o notation provides a way of 
measuring the running time of algorithms such as binary search or Robbins-Monro Algorithm.


3. Omega Notation ($\omega$): 

Omega notation is a mathematical tool used in asymptotic analysis to describe the worst case running time of an 
algorithm. It allows us to compare algorithms by approximating their average and worst case values, 
particularly when analyzing data structures or other complex functions. Omega notation expresses the rate at 
which the running time increases with respect to input size, using logarithmic form rather than a simple function. 
This makes it possible to predict how long a program will take in the most unfavorable circumstances (worst case scenario).


4. Big Theta Notation ($\theta$): 

Big theta notation is a mathematical unit used to describe asymptotic analysis. 
It measures the approximate time complexity of an algorithm, and provides insight into how long it will take for 
a given function to complete its task. Big Theta notation consists of twofold functions: 
one that shows growth at larger values and another which examines behaviour near fixed constants.

In determining the running time of an algorithm, big theta offers several advantages over other notational 
methods such as omega notation. By providing insights into both large values and small ones, 
it has greater scope than before - allowing us to understand performance across all scenarios.

Furthermore, by isolating potential remainder terms, it helps us analyse where exactly our calculations are 
falling short of expectations. This makes it easier for us to adjust parameters or refine our approach so 
that we reach more accurate results faster.

### Conclusion
The four primary types of asymptotic notations are:

- Big O Notation,
- Little O Notation,
- Omega Notation
- Big Theta Notation

Each measures the complexity of an algorithm by describing how its runtime or memory usage grows with respect 
to input size. With this information in hand, developers can tailor algorithms to best fit their needs, 
making systems faster and more efficient.

In conclusion, Asymptotic Analysis provides developers with valuable insights into the behavior of complex algorithms.
By measuring the runtime or memory usage of these algorithms with various inputs,
they can identify areas where optimization will be most effective. 

Furthermore, understanding different types of asymptotic notations helps developers make informed decisions 
when choosing which algorithm to use in any given situation. Ultimately, Asymptotic Analysis is an essential 
tool that every programmer should master if they wish to create fast and efficient software solutions.
