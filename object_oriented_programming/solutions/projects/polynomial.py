# Write a Python program that inputs a polynomial in standard algebraic notation
# and outputs the first derivative of that polynomial.

# degree of the polynomial - tells us how many roots can be found in a polynomial equation.
# variables of the polynomial equation
# exponents of the polynomial equation
# coefficients of the polynomial equation
# an(xn) = a is the coefficient, x is the variable, and n is the exponent.
# F(x) = anxn + an-1xn-1 + an-2xn-2 + …….. + a1x +a0 = 0
