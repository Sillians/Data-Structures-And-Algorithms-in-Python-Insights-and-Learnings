# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms-in-Python-Insights-and-Learnings
This repository contains my overarching approach to learning Data Structures and Algorithm in Python. 
It contains everything and anything of my journey towards grokking Data Structures and Algorithm. 
All the implementations are for learning and research purposes only. 


## How to Fix ModuleNotFoundError and ImportError
- Use absolute imports

Append your project’s root directory to PYTHONPATH — In any environment you wish to run your Python application such as Docker, 
vagrant or your virtual environment i.e. in bin/activate, run (or e.g. add to bin/activate in case you are using virtualenv) the below command:

`export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/your/project/"`
